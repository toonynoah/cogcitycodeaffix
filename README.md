# Cogcity: Code AFFIX Wiki (This is also the Tutorial/Cogtorial script)

# Cogcity: Code AFFIX is a remake of Disney's Toontown Online (Furry Game XD) but in Cogcity, things have changed and have gotten less funnier and less wackier.

# This time, you play as a cog. The folks at  work hard on this game, and they want a ton of people to play their game.

# The less wackier Cogcity is in present, the less wackier it will be in the future.

# Over 400 lines of code, (not much lol) this game is pretty good. That's not a lot of lines, but it's a lot of "Cogs's Custom Fun.

# Did I just say "Cogs's Custom Fun? Oh, I forgot to tell you.

# "Cogs's Custom Fun" is the Cogs's own custom type of fun form. Unlike the Toons, they have the SAME EXACT TIME OF FUN, it's like a robot, lol.

# So what do the Cogs's do when they have a lot of "Cogs's Custom Fun"? Well, they fight the Toons. And they get together with a Cog form called "Goons". The Goons are like managers of the Cogs and the Goons help the Cogs fight the Toons so they have BONUS/EXTRA credit.

# That's all you need to learn for now. Bye! Also, please...

# PAY YOUR RESPECTS IN COGCITY! Are You COG ENOUGH? (Bad reference to Disney's commerical Lol)
